Docker Image is a set of files which has no state, whereas Docker Container is the instantiation of Docker Image. In other words, Docker Container is the run time instance of images.

images are frozen immutable snapshots of live containers. Containers are running (or stopped) instances of some image.


to run an image from a Container we use 
docker run (container)

                image 
fs snapshot                 Startup command
hello-world                 run hello-world


                container
    process
        ||
    kernel
        ||
    Ram,network,cpu,filesystem

when we run the command run-helloworld

docker takes the fs snapshot and puts it in the filesystem available for the container, and the process became hello world


                container
    process(hello-world)
        ||
    kernel
        ||
    Ram,network,cpu,filesystem(fs snapshot hello-world)
