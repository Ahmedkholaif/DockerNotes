if we do 
docker run redis 
redis will run but if we want to use the redis-cli with it , it won't have access to the container where redis is up and running 
we want to start the redis cli within the same container where redis is up 
docker exec -it <container id> <command>
docker exec -it df5c591cd99b redis-cli   (df5c591cd99b is the id of my redis container)
127.0.0.1:6379> set myName loai
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get myName
"loai"

the -it flag importance 
-it is short for --interactive + --tty when you docker run with this command.. it would take you straight inside of the container,The ‘-it’ in a docker command makes the container interactive with the terminal, if we don't add it, it will terminate immediately
how it works 

--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached
-t		                prettying the output

every container has three channels to communicate with the other containers and the terminal 
Stdin - Stdout - Stderr
stdin to get input
stdout to output 
stderr to output errors 

when we use -i it means we want to attach our terminal to the stdin of the redis-cli.



docker exec -it <container id> <command> sh
will give you a shell within your container, you can do all the commands within your container 
to exit it, we can ctl+c or ctl+d
