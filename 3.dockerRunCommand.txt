                image 
fs snapshot                 Startup command
hello-world                 run hello-world


                container
    process
        ||
    kernel
        ||
    Ram,network,cpu,filesystem

when we run the command run-helloworld

docker takes the fs snapshot and puts it in the filesystem available for the container, and the process became hello world


                container
    process(hello-world)
        ||
    kernel
        ||
    Ram,network,cpu,filesystem(fs snapshot hello-world)
======================================================================
=============docker run command variations ===========================

docker run imageName override command (echo hi there is the override command below)
docker run busybox echo hi there 

these override commands has to exist within the docker image so i can override it, if it doesn't exist, it will throw an error
running docker run hello-world echo hi there will throw, because within its fs snapshot there's no echo command

container life cycle 

docker run = docker create + docker start
when you run the command docker run, it creates a container from the image then starts it
remember to use -a flag when using docker start, it will attach to the container and output to the console what the container is outputting
