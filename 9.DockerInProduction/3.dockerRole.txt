docker is a tool that makes executing some tasks alot easier
it's not necessarily a requirement.

-------------------------
since we will create two docker files, one for production , one for development
the file for development will be called Dockerfile.development
to be able to build it we need to use -f flag since docker build looks for a file named Dockerfile without any extension 

docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .
